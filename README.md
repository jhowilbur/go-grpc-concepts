# Overview of gRPC Communication

gRPC is a high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that uses Protocol Buffers as its serialization format. It allows for applications to communicate with each other over a network and call methods on a remote server as if they were local.

There are four main types of communication patterns supported by gRPC:

1. Unary Communication
Unary communication involves a single request from the client to the server and a single response from the server to the client. This is the simplest and most common type of communication pattern in gRPC.
Unary communication is useful for simple client-server interactions.


2. Server Streaming Communication
Server streaming communication involves a single request from the client to the server, but the server sends back a stream of responses. This allows the server to send large amounts of data to the client in a continuous stream.
Server streaming communication is useful for real-time updates.


3. Client Streaming Communication
Client streaming communication involves the client sending a stream of requests to the server, and the server sends back a single response. This pattern is useful when the client needs to send a large amount of data to the server.
Client streaming communication can be used for uploading large files.


4. Bidirectional Streaming Communication
Bidirectional streaming communication involves both the client and the server sending streams of messages to each other. This allows for real-time communication and is useful for scenarios where both the client and server need to send and receive data continuously.
Bidirectional streaming communication can be used for real-time collaboration between clients and servers.

Each of these communication patterns provides different possibilities for building distributed systems. By choosing the appropriate pattern for a given scenario, developers can create efficient and scalable systems using gRPC.
